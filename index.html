            <h1>Youtube, Re-imagined</h1>
            <p>-> "Welcome title, mood buttons" - to display the videos based on his/her choice</p>
            <p>-> "Roadmap on the right" - to click on the years and the navigation moves to that particular year and videos released/related to that particular year are fetched. Couldn't add clicks using CSS</p>
            <p>-> "Find out what's happening near you" - for displaying the videos around the user's location</p>
            <p>-> The actual homepage of youtube with videos will be displayed after this page i designed. This is my idea.</p>
            <p>-> I couldn't change the website dynamically as i am not feeling well. I just wanted to showcase my ideas</p>
            <p>-> Including canva design file for better idea <a href="https://lalithayt.my.canva.site/">Click here</a>
